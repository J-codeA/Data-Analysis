These files contain the results of clustering the data in the dataset, changing the k and number of seeds within each attempt to determine what may be the best model to go off of.  The Ks were changed to 2, 10, 25 with the seed changed to 10, 50, and 100 respectively.  

K means the number of clusters while the seed is a random number that is generated through a random number generator.
